## Requirements

1. Install [Opus dependencies](https://github.com/hraban/opus?tab=readme-ov-file#build--installation)

    If `opusfile.pc` is not found on macOS, try `sudo port install opusfile` instead of `brew install opusfile`, using MacPorts.

3. Install `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`

Also need `neofetch` and `sed` for `info` command.
